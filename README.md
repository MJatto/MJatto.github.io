# How to Host Your Resume on GitHub Pages

## Getting Started

This is just an instruction set that will guide a user on how to go about writing or editing a resume in Atom using Markdown and hosting that resume on a Github page using a static website generator called Jekyll. The instructions are intended for individuals who are not fully skilled in the knowledge of either Atom, Github Pages, Jekyll or Markdown.

## Prerequisites

Softwares that needed to be installed for this process are a Markdown text editor (Atom used in this process) and a static website generator (Jekyll used in this process). Users would also need to create an account on GitHub Pages.

| Software | Description |

| Atom     | Atom is the text editor used in this project to edit/write a resume in Markdown. |  
| Jekyll  | Jekyll is a static generator website which you can use to host sites right from your Github repositories. |
| Github | GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. |

## Instructions

#### How to post a resume on GitHub Pages
Before anything you would need to edit/write a resume to be posted, it should be edited/written in Markdown (saved as a index.md file) using Atom (as in this project) or any Markdown text editor.
1. Once the resume has been edited properly in Markdown, open your Github account created earlier. This is your GitHub Page.
2. On the hompage, at the top-right corner you should see a plus sign dropdown "**+**", click on it.
3. After clicking a dropdown box should appear, then click on "**New Repository**". This should take you to the **Create New Repository** page.
4. Once here fill out the information required, this is indicated with the red asterisks.
5. Tick the box that says "**Initialize this repository with a README**". This would help you clone the repository to your computer. Then click on **Create Repository**. Once this is done it takes you to your repository homepage
6. Once here, just before the list of your current files, you should see a button called "**Upload Files**", click on it.
7. Select the ".md" file which you saved your edited resume with and click on upload. This should upload your resume unto your Github Page.

#### How to format a resume using a Jekyll supported theme
1. After uploading a resume on your Github Page, on the homepage of your GitHub, at the right hand side you should see a **Settings** tab, click on it.
2. This takes you to the repository settings page, when here scroll down to "**Github Pages**" section and click on **Change Theme**
3. This should take you to a page to select from a range of Jekyll themes, select a theme that you feel best complements your resume then click on **Select Theme**.
4. Once this is done, your resume has been automatically formatted using the selected theme.
